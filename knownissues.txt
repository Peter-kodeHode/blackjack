Known issues: 

Can place empty bets or enter text

Two aces at start results in 22 and bust. Aces should be 1 when needed and 11 when not.

Bet section has no value after win, but last bet shows nonetheless.

When dealer wins, the bet is added like this 50000 + 500 = 50000500 instead of 50500

If it's a tie the "win proceedings" are added like above. Disgusting

If the sum of my hand is higher than 16 but still higher than the dealers' hand I can't stand and can only hit. 
This will very easily lead to you going bust.

Gotta implement so that the non numeric cards I fetch from the API can be parsed into number instead of string
and can from there be used in the mathematical equations of the game.

Gotta fix the input boxes on bet and name.

Add max character limit on name so it doesn't break the layout completely
